# shell

This project is a minimal Unix-style shell written in C. It focuses on low-level systems programming concepts such as process creation, memory management, and command parsing.

Key Concepts Include
- Process control using `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`
- Manual memory management and pointer usage
- Tokenizing and parsing user input
- Error handling and defensive programming in C

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of how software interacts with the operating system at a low level. Many of the same concepts—manual memory control, state handling, and careful error management—carry directly into embedded and firmware development.
